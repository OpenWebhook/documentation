# Introduction

## Why

Working with webhooks is painful because you need:
- To trigger the webhook
- To convey the webhook to your dev environment

Open webhooks gives you a public URL that stores a webhook for as long as you want. 

You'll never have to configure a new temporary ngrok url. Whenever a webhook is received, anyone from your team can analyze and replay this webhook.
