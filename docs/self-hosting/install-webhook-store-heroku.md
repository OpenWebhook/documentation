# Install a Webhook Store

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new Webhook Store**.

Or **try Open Webhook immediately** with **[openwebhook.io](https://demo.openwebhook.io)** with some github webhooks.

### What you'll need

- A [Heroku](https://heroku.com) account to create a workspace with
  - [A dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/dynos)
  - [A database](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-plans#hobby-tier)
- The [heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-with-an-installer)

## Create an Webhook Store

Clone the webhook store project

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenWebhook/webhook-store.git && cd webhook-store
```

Create a heroku app

```bash
heroku create webhook-store-YOURORG
```

Add a database

```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

Push the project on heroku

```bash
git push heroku
```

## Test your webhook store

Your store should be up on your Heroku domain [webhook-store-YOURORG.herokuapp.com](https://webhook-store-YOURORG.herokuapp.com).

Use Curl to POST a webhook on the store

```sh
curl -X POST https://webhook-store-YOURORG.herokuapp.com/webhook/some-url -d 'yolo=croute'
```

You should see that your webhook was received by the store ðŸŽ‰.
